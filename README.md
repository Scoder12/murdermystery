[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FScoder12%2Fmurdermystery.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FScoder12%2Fmurdermystery?ref=badge_shield)


A web game by Scoder12

It is made with next.js, typescript, and Go.

I wanted to use Protocol Buffers for the server-client communication, but I really don't want to use Google Closure Compiler
or any other heavy dependencies to the project.
